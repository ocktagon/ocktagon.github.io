<h3>Enumerable Methods in Ruby</h3>
<h5>Apr 5th, 2014</h5>
<p>
Dealing with arrays is a common task in programming, and taking a moment to talk about Enumerables.  </p>
<p>In Ruby, Enumerable provides many instance methods to help in making manipulating arrays less cumbersome.  For a good way to look up what kind of methods there are, the command <font style="background:skyblue; color:blue">Enumerable.instance_methods.sort</font> works like a charm.  This is a great place to start when dealing with an unfamiliar set of methods: </p>

Of the many Enumerable methods available, I find that <font style="background:skyblue; color:blue">Enumerable#map</font> is really useful as it allows for alteration of each element in array in one relatively easy-to-read command.  The example below shows how an array or integers or strings can be altered with map.  The method can apply a modification to each element in an array and return the result, which can be very powerful to manage big data collections.

<p>The map method can also be used for a destructive operation to alter the original input array.  This is done by adding a "!", so by using ".map!" instead of "map".  </p>

<h3>JavaScript vs. Ruby</h3>
<h5>March 28th, 2014</h5>
<p>
With Unit 1/Week 3 of bootcamp prepation behind me, I wanted to take a moment to reflect on some impressions left after coding through JavaScript and Ruby.  
<ul>
<li><h4>Quick Impressions</h4></li>
<p>JavaScript and Ruby both support object-oriented, and have a relatively easier to learn syntax compared to other programming languages.  Comparing syntax, would say that JavaScript is definitely influenced by C programming, while Ruby is less cryptic and easier to read/interpet even if you don't know a programming language.  So far, I have seen JavaScript commonly applied in client-side (web browser) situations, while Ruby seems to be a more general-purpose language. </p>
<li><h4>Methods and Functions</h4></li>
<p>
In JavaScript, it's common to define functions.  In Ruby, it's common to define methods.  For a simple "hello world" program, the syntax is pretty straight forward for either case.

<li><h4>Constructor Function versus Class</h4></li>
<p>JavaScript and Ruby can both be object-oriented, or in other words methods and functions of a similar kind can be created and defined as such.  For example, there could be a object called "Person" which acts like a blueprint (also called prototype in JS), to be used for more specific people like "Dave" or "Jane".  In the code , the blueprints are represented as either constructor functions (JavaScript) or a Class (Ruby), and the specific people can be represented as specific 'instances' or 'objects' of the blueprint.  <br /><br />

This makes much more sense when comparing the code below.  Both snippets of code are creating a Person with the attributes of name, age, and quote.  After the blueprint is created, a specific instance called dave with unique attributes is being created.  Syntax is slightly different, but both languages are very powerful from the magic of object oriented programming</p>

<li><h4>Summary</h4></li>
<p>
Reflecting on the last 2 weeks being focused on Ruby and JavaScript, with all the similarities in mind, I do still have to be honest to say that I am partial towards Ruby.  I started both languages at the same time.  Where I have had trouble recalling half of the JavaScript concepts due to syntax, Ruby is just easier to recall how to do the same things - probably because it's a very readable syntax for the common english-speaking citizen.  Also, I have repeatedly been impressed with Ruby's zen-like elegance of being able to do more with less code, whether it be for setting up loops, conditionals, or processing arrays and hashes.  Also a big plus that Ruby was invented by a Japanese guy named matz, which makes me want to support it more.

<li><div id="font_question">Pick one value and write a couple of sentences about why one of the values you chose is important to you.</div></li>
<p>It's really hard to pick just one among the many important ones in this list.  Achievement, mastery and purpose are important things I believe everyone strives to have.  The emotions I picked above represent the satisfaction I get when something meaningful has been accomplished. </p>
<li><div id="font_question">In general, I try to live up to these values:</div></li>
<p>
Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- <font style="background:yellow; color:red">5</font> Agree
</p>
<li><div id="font_question">What was the last topic that someone asked for your advice on?
</div></li>
<p>I recently had students ask me for career advice, and was very excited to be able to help tap into their passions.</p>

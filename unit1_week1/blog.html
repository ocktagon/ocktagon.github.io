<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.basecamp.com">BaseCamp</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.hbogo.com">HBO GO</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.personalcapital.com">Personal Capital</a></li>
</ul>
<div id="font_question">
Why is this one of your favorite sites?
</div>
<p>
BC: Because it’s so intuitively useful as a info sharing tool  <br />
HBO GO: Because it’s TV binge-viewing heaven  <br />
PC: Best free financial management app   <br />
</p>

<div id="font_question">
What area of the site is your eye drawn to when looking at the homepage? Stand back further, what area is your eye drawn to now? Is that area the most important area of the site?
</div>
<p>
BC: In the middle and top nav.  Always interact w it in the same way.<br />
HBO GO: Basically everywhere because all the shows have great images.   It’s designed for consuming video, which I like a lot.<br />
PC: Attention goes to the left side nav with portfolios/accounts.  Right is good charts etc. per account so a user will use both. <br />
</p>

<div id="font_question">
How would you describe the website visually? List 5 adjectives. (i.e. "pretty", "elegant", "simple", "dark", "cluttered", "basic" etc)
</div>
<p>
BC - Simple, somewhat cluttered.  Sketchbook like.  Fun.<br />
HBO GO - Cool.  Visual.  Engaging<br />
PC - Professional, classic, organized<br />
</p>

<div id="font_question">
What problem does this website solve? What content does it have?
</div>
<p>
BC: Projects to collaborate on.  The users create their own content to share <br />
HBO GO: View tons of movies and shows on the go<br />
PC: Consolidate and manage investments<br />
</p>
<div id="font_question">
What 5 adjectives would you use to describe the content, focus, and purpose of the site? (i.e. "practical", "fun", "whimsical", "silly", "serious" etc) How does that compare to the adjectives you used to describe the site visually?
</div>
<p>
BC: Professional, not glamorous, practical.  The website brings simplicity and fun to a boring subject matter.<br />
HBO GO: Recommending, Listing, Informing, Catalog <br />
PC: Serious, Professional, Informative, Advising <br />
</p>

<div id="font_question">
How easy is it to find what you are looking for from the homepage? How about from another page?
</div>

<p>
For all 3 websites, it’s pretty easy to find everything.  The user flows are very natural and each site is very focused in the subject matter.
</p>
<div id="font_question">
How easy is it to browse through all the content of the site?
</div>
<p>
BC: Although they try to keep it simple, it does get cluttered and hard to find things <br />
HBO GO: Excellent experience.  It's planned out for tons of content.<br />
PC: Pretty straightforward for simple things<br />

<div id="font_question">
How do you feel after being on the site for a while? (i.e. "bored", "happy", "anxious or hyper", "like I wasted a lot of time” etc)
</div>
<p>
BC: productive but wouldn’t want to stay long<br />
HBO GO: I’d stay here as long as there was stuff to watch<br />
PC: Not a place I’d stay at, but very useful to use regularly<br />
</p>

<div id="font_question">
Does the site sell anything? If so, have you purchased any of it? Why or why not?
</div>
<p>
BC: Yes, use their service at work<br />
HBO GO: Yes, HBO GO comes free with Cable/HBO subscription<br />
PC: Yes, asked for help from financial advisor service, as well as free service.<br />
